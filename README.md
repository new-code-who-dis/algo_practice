edx algo practice - tre basique methods, constructive criticism is inspiring

I'm hella jealous of anyone who got a formal education in algos and man oh man do I wish the time I spent in that stupid project management class I had just spent in a high stress, unsupportive, content heavy algorithms class like any deserving technology student.

Trying to relive the glory days now by taking a course online https://www.edx.org/search?q=algorithms 
The one I'm on now is gonna expire soon so might as well "share the haggis" (ANTM Cycle 18: British Invasion) and drop that link here if anyone's looking for similar resources 

If you stumble on this shit and have some suggestions - let me know
For without another dev's perspective, how will my own grow <3
